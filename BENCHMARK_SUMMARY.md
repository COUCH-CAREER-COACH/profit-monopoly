## Performance Analysis

1. **Basic Operations**
   - Addition and multiplication are extremely fast (~20ns) with zero allocations
   - Both operations can handle ~50-70M ops/sec on M1
   - No memory overhead due to efficient in-place operations
   - Perfect for high-frequency calculations

2. **Price Impact & Profitability**
   - Price impact is very efficient (248.7ns, 3 allocs)
   - Profitability calculation takes 676.4ns with 9 allocations
   - Both operations can handle >1M calculations per second
   - Memory usage is well-optimized (96-336 bytes per op)

3. **MEV Strategy Execution**
   - SIMD comparison is memory-intensive (8KB per op) but handles 1000 elements
   - Sandwich attacks are most complex (1.75μs, 22 allocs)
   - Cross-exchange arb is efficient (1μs, 12 allocs)
   - JIT liquidation is fastest strategy (619.6ns, 9 allocs)

4. **Memory Usage**
   - Basic ops use zero allocations
   - Strategy operations use 300-800 bytes per op
   - SIMD uses large but single allocation (8KB)
   - Memory efficiency decreases with strategy complexity

## Recommendations

1. **Latency Optimization**
   - Prioritize JIT liquidations (<1μs) for time-critical ops
   - Consider parallel SIMD for large arrays
   - Optimize sandwich attack allocations (currently 22)
   - Pre-calculate common values to reduce basic op calls

2. **Memory Management**
   - Implement object pooling for sandwich attacks
   - Consider reducing SIMD batch size for memory efficiency
   - Add allocation limits for high-frequency operations
   - Cache common BigInt values

3. **Strategy Improvements**
   - Prioritize JIT liquidations for best performance
   - Use parallel processing for SIMD operations
   - Implement strategy-specific memory pools
   - Add profitability thresholds based on latency

4. **Risk Management**
   - Set operation timeouts based on benchmark results
   - Monitor allocation patterns in production
   - Implement circuit breakers for high-memory operations
   - Add latency-based strategy switching
